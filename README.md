### Ross Simpson ðŸ‘‹ â€” AI Infrastructure / SRE (Azure â€¢ AKS â€¢ LLM Serving)

Ex-Spotify incident and operatons lead (managing global traffic influx events, such as Spotify Wrapped) and cloud/infrastructure engineer at a SaaS startup.  
I build reliable, observable systems on **Azure/AKS** with a focus on **LLM serving, RAG backends, and GPU orchestration**.  
Strengths: incident response, SLOs & cost control, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, Prometheus/Grafana, and OpenTelemetry.  

**Relocating to San Francisco in Feb 2026 â€” open to AI Infra / SRE roles (hybrid/remote).**

ðŸ‘‰ Highlight projects (coming soon):  
- LLM serving on AKS (**vLLM vs Triton**)  
- RAG backend with pgvector + evals in CI  
- Observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry
