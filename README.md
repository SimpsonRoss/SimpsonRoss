### ðŸ‘‹ Ross Simpson â€” AI Infrastructure / SRE (Azure â€¢ AKS â€¢ LLM Serving)

Ex-Spotify incident & operations lead (Spotify Wrapped season traffic spikes) and cloud/infrastructure engineer at a SaaS startup.  
I build reliable, observable systems on **Azure/AKS** focused on **LLM serving, RAG backends, and GPU orchestration**.  
Strengths: incident response, SLOs & cost control, CI/CD, Kubernetes, Prometheus/Grafana, OpenTelemetry.

** ðŸš‹ Relocating to San Francisco â€¢ Feb 2026** â€” open to **AI Infra / SRE** roles (hybrid/remote).
